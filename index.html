    <body> <p> Hi, my name is Alex Jambunathan and I am currently a first year student at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT).
         I am a Computing Exploration major, which consists of taking a lot of introductory computer science classes. 
         By the end of my first year I will have to declare a major within Golisano College of Computing and Information Sciences. </p>
